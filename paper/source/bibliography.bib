journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
abstract = {Despite having been discovered more than three decades ago, high temperature superconductors (HTSs) lack both an explanation for their mechanisms and a systematic way to search for them. To aid this search, this project proposes ScGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) to efficiently predict new superconductors. ScGAN was trained on compounds in Open Quantum Materials Database and then transfer learned onto the SuperCon database or a subset of it. Once trained, the GAN was used to predict superconducting candidates, and approximately 70% of them were determined to be superconducting by a classification model–a 23-fold increase in discovery rate compared to manual search methods. Furthermore, more than 99% of predictions were novel materials, demonstrating that ScGAN was able to potentially predict completely new superconductors, including several promising HTS candidates. This project presents a novel, efficient way to search for new superconductors, which may be used in technological applications or provide insight into the unsolved problem of high temperature superconductivity.}

Here, we develop an approach that simultaneously achieves both flexibility and tractability. The essential idea, inspired by non-equilibrium statistical physics, is to systematically and slowly destroy structure in a data distribution through an iterative forward diffusion process. We then learn a reverse diffusion process that restores structure in data, yielding a highly flexible and tractable generative model of the data. This approach allows us to rapidly learn, sample from, and evaluate probabilities in deep generative models with thousands of layers or time steps, as well as to compute conditional and posterior probabilities under the learned model. We additionally release an open source reference implementation of the algorithm.}

abstract = {Machine learning models are gaining increasing popularity in the domain of fluid dynamics for their potential to accelerate the production of high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics data. However, many recently proposed machine learning models for high-fidelity data reconstruction require low-fidelity data for model training. Such requirement restrains the application performance of these models, since their data reconstruction accuracy would drop significantly if the low-fidelity input data used in model test has a large deviation from the training data. To overcome this restraint, we propose a diffusion model which only uses high-fidelity data at training. With different configurations, our model is able to reconstruct high-fidelity data from either a regular low-fidelity sample or a randomly measured sample, and is also able to gain an accuracy increase by using physics-informed conditioning information from a known partial differential equation when that is available. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can produce accurate reconstruction results for 2d turbulent flows based on different input sources without retraining.}

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net.",

abstract={The promise of quantum computers is that certain computational tasks might be executed exponentially faster on a quantum processor than on a classical processor1. A fundamental challenge is to build a high-fidelity processor capable of running quantum algorithms in an exponentially large computational space. Here we report the use of a processor with programmable superconducting qubits2--7 to create quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding to a computational state-space of dimension 253 (about 1016). Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times---our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy8--14 for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm.},

abstract={Superconductivity has been the focus of enormous research effort since its discovery more than a century ago. Yet, some features of this unique phenomenon remain poorly understood; prime among these is the connection between superconductivity and chemical/structural properties of materials. To bridge the gap, several machine learning schemes are developed herein to model the critical temperatures (Tc) of the 12,000+ known superconductors available via the SuperCon database. Materials are first divided into two classes based on their Tc values, above and below 10{\thinspace}K, and a classification model predicting this label is trained. The model uses coarse-grained features based only on the chemical compositions. It shows strong predictive power, with out-of-sample accuracy of about 92{\%}. Separate regression models are developed to predict the values of Tc for cuprate, iron-based, and low-Tccompounds. These models also demonstrate good performance, with learned predictors offering potential insights into the mechanisms behind superconductivity in different families of materials. To improve the accuracy and interpretability of these models, new features are incorporated using materials data from the AFLOW Online Repositories. Finally, the classification and regression models are combined into a single-integrated pipeline and employed to search the entire Inorganic Crystallographic Structure Database (ICSD) for potential new superconductors. We identify >30 non-cuprate and non-iron-based oxides as candidate materials.},

Forming a four-component compound from the first 103 elements of the periodic table results in more than 1012 combinations. Such a materials space is intractable to high-throughput experiment or first-principle computation. We introduce a framework to address this problem and quantify how many materials can exist. We apply principles of valency and electronegativity to filter chemically implausible compositions, which reduces the inorganic quaternary space to 1010 combinations. We demonstrate that estimates of band gaps and absolute electron energies can be made simply on the basis of the chemical composition and apply this to the search for new semiconducting materials to support the photoelectrochemical splitting of water. We show the applicability to predicting crystal structure by analogy with known compounds, including exploration of the phase space for ternary combinations that form a perovskite lattice. Computer screening reproduces known perovskite materials and predicts the feasibility of thousands more. Given the simplicity of the approach, large-scale searches can be performed on a single workstation.}

abstract={A major challenge in materials design is how to efficiently search the vast chemical design space to find the materials with desired properties. One effective strategy is to develop sampling algorithms that can exploit both explicit chemical knowledge and implicit composition rules embodied in the large materials database. Here, we propose a generative machine learning model (MatGAN) based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) for efficient generation of new hypothetical inorganic materials. Trained with materials from the ICSD database, our GAN model can generate hypothetical materials not existing in the training dataset, reaching a novelty of 92.53{\%} when generating 2 million samples. The percentage of chemically valid (charge-neutral and electronegativity-balanced) samples out of all generated ones reaches 84.5{\%} when generated by our GAN trained with such samples screened from ICSD, even though no such chemical rules are explicitly enforced in our GAN model, indicating its capability to learn implicit chemical composition rules to form compounds. Our algorithm is expected to be used to greatly expand the range of the design space for inverse design and large-scale computational screening of inorganic materials.},

Two different “phase diagrams” based on the doping (p) dependence of T* are currently considered: one where T* falls to zero at a critical doping state and the other where T* merges with Tc in the overdoped region. By examining the temperature dependence of the NMR Knight shift and relaxation rate, entropy, resistivity, infrared conductivity, Raman scattering, ARPES and tunnelling data, it is concluded that the second scenario is not at all supported. Neither can one distinguish a small and a large pseudogap as is often done. T* is an energy scale, which falls abruptly to zero at p=0.19. Colour figures are available at cond-mat/0005063.}

abstract = {Motivated by the recent synthesis of Ba2CuO3+δ (BCO), a high temperature superconducting cuprate with putative d3z2−r2 ground state symmetry, we investigated its electronic structure by means of Cu L3 x-ray absorption (XAS) and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Cu L3 edge on a polycrystalline sample. We show that the XAS profile of BCO is characterised by two peaks associated to inequivalent Cu sites, and that its RIXS response features a single, sharp peak associated to crystal-field excitations. We argue that these observations are only partially compatible with the previously proposed crystal structure of BCO. Based on our spectroscopic results and on previously published powder diffraction measurements, we propose a crystalline structure characterized by two inequivalent Cu sites located at alternated planes along the c axis: nominally trivalent Cu(1) belonging to very short Cu-O chains, and divalent Cu(2) in the oxygen deficient CuO1.5 planes. We also analyze the low-energy region of the RIXS spectra to estimate the magnitude of the magnetic interactions in BCO and find that in-plane nearest neighbor superexchange exceeds 120 meV, similarly to that of other layered cuprates. Although these results do not support the pure d3z2−r2 ground state scenario, they hint at a significant departure from the common quasi-2D electronic structure of superconducting cuprates of pure dx2−y2 symmetry.}

In our study, we observe the structural, mechanical, thermodynamic, electronic and optical properties of LiGa2Rh Heusler superconductor in a cubic system using DFT based first-principles calculation. The structure is found to be very ductile with high anisotropy nature and band structure suggests its metallicity. According to optical properties, the maximum amount of absorption occurs for low energy UV photons, with plasma frequency occurring at 16.309 eV. In the UV region, the amount of reflectivity and optical conductivity also high but the refractive index has a broad peak in the visible region. We found here a negative magnetic moment which is -0.98µB. Our analysis shows that this structure has a huge probability in optoelectronic applications.}

abstract={High-temperature superconductivity in iron pnictides occurs when electrons and holes are doped into their antiferromagnetic parent compounds. Since spin excitations may be responsible for electron pairing and superconductivity, it is important to determine their electron/hole-doping evolution and connection with superconductivity. Here we use inelastic neutron scattering to show that while electron doping to the antiferromagnetic BaFe2As2 parent compound modifies the low-energy spin excitations and their correlation with superconductivity (<50{\thinspace}meV) without affecting the high-energy spin excitations (>100{\thinspace}meV), hole-doping suppresses the high-energy spin excitations and shifts the magnetic spectral weight to low-energies. In addition, our absolute spin susceptibility measurements for the optimally hole-doped iron pnictide reveal that the change in magnetic exchange energy below and above Tc can account for the superconducting condensation energy. These results suggest that high-Tc superconductivity in iron pnictides is associated with both the presence of high-energy spin excitations and a coupling between low-energy spin excitations and itinerant electrons.},

abstract={The Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD) is a high-throughput database currently consisting of nearly 300,000 density functional theory (DFT) total energy calculations of compounds from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) and decorations of commonly occurring crystal structures. To maximise the impact of these data, the entire database is being made available, without restrictions, at www.oqmd.org/download. In this paper, we outline the structure and contents of the database, and then use it to evaluate the accuracy of the calculations therein by comparing DFT predictions with experimental measurements for the stability of all elemental ground-state structures and 1,670 experimental formation energies of compounds. This represents the largest comparison between DFT and experimental formation energies to date. The apparent mean absolute error between experimental measurements and our calculations is 0.096{\thinspace}eV/atom. In order to estimate how much error to attribute to the DFT calculations, we also examine deviation between different experimental measurements themselves where multiple sources are available, and find a surprisingly large mean absolute error of 0.082{\thinspace}eV/atom. Hence, we suggest that a significant fraction of the error between DFT and experimental formation energies may be attributed to experimental uncertainties. Finally, we evaluate the stability of compounds in the OQMD (including compounds obtained from the ICSD as well as hypothetical structures), which allows us to predict the existence of {\textasciitilde}3,200 new compounds that have not been experimentally characterised and uncover trends in material discovery, based on historical data available within the ICSD.},

In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to ½ everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation.

With the advancements in modern machine learning (ML) technology, a keen interest in applying these algorithms to further CMP research has created a compelling new area of research at the intersection of both fields. In this review, we aim to explore the main areas within CMP, which have successfully applied ML techniques to further research, such as the description and use of ML schemes for potential energy surfaces, the characterization of topological phases of matter in lattice systems, the prediction of phase transitions in off-lattice and atomistic simulations, the interpretation of ML theories with physics-inspired frameworks and the enhancement of simulation methods with ML algorithms. We also discuss in detail the main challenges and drawbacks of using ML methods on CMP problems, as well as some perspectives for future developments.}

ABSTRACT = {The two most important aspects of material research using deep learning (DL) or machine learning (ML) are the characteristics of materials data and learning algorithms, where the proper characterization of materials data is essential for generating accurate models. At present, the characterization of materials based on the molecular composition includes some methods based on feature engineering, such as Magpie and One-hot. Although these characterization methods have achieved significant results in materials research, these methods based on feature engineering cannot guarantee the integrity of materials characterization. One possible approach is to learn the materials characterization via neural networks using the chemical knowledge and implicit composition rules shown in large-scale known materials. This article chooses an adversarial method to learn the composition of atoms using the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which makes sense for data symmetry. The total loss value of the discriminator on the test set is reduced from 4.1e13 to 0.3194, indicating that the designed GAN network can well capture the combination of atoms in real materials. We then use the trained discriminator weights for material characterization and predict bandgap, formation energy, critical temperature (Tc) of superconductors on the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD), Materials Project (MP), and SuperCond datasets. Experiments show that when using the same predictive model, our proposed method performs better than One-hot and Magpie. This article provides an effective method for characterizing materials based on molecular composition in addition to Magpie, One-hot, etc. In addition, the generator learned in this study generates hypothetical materials with the same distribution as known materials, and these hypotheses can be used as a source for new material discovery.},

We used the SuperCon database, as well as our own data sets complied from literature, in order to explore how machine learning algorithms groups superconductors. Both conventional clustering methods like k-means, hierarchical or Gaussian mixtures, as well as clustering methods based on artificial neural networks like self-organizing maps, were used. For dimensionality reduction and visualization t-SNE was found to be the best choice. Our results indicate that machine learning techniques can achieve, and in some cases exceed, human level performance. Calculations suggest that the clustering of superconducting materials works best when machine learning techniques are used in concert with human knowledge of superconductors. We also show that in order to resolve fine subcluster structure in the data, clustering of superconducting materials should be done in stages.}

abstract={Neural network-based generative models have been actively investigated as an inverse design method for finding novel materials in a vast design space. However, the applicability of conventional generative models is limited because they cannot access data outside the range of training sets. Advanced generative models that were devised to overcome the limitation also suffer from the weak predictive power on the unseen domain. In this study, we propose a deep neural network-based forward design approach that enables an efficient search for superior materials far beyond the domain of the initial training set. This approach compensates for the weak predictive power of neural networks on an unseen domain through gradual updates of the neural network with active transfer learning and data augmentation methods. We demonstrate the potential of our framework with a grid composite optimization problem that has an astronomical number of possible design configurations. Results show that our proposed framework can provide excellent designs close to the global optima, even with the addition of a very small dataset corresponding to less than 0.5{\%} of the initial training dataset size.},
