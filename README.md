This is the implementation of SuperDiff, a state-of-the-art method for computationally generating new hypothetical superconductors. SuperDiff is a new method for generating hypothetical superconductors using Diffusion Models and is the first computational superconductor generation method to generate hypothetical new families of superconductors and also the first to have support for conditioning on reference compounds. This repository contains the code, instructions, and model weights necessary to train or directly run a version of SuperDiff. SuperDiff was created by Samuel Yuan and Sasa Dordevic, you may reach us at [sdkyuan@gmail.com](mailto:sdkyuan@gmail.com) and [dsasa@uakron.edu](mailto:dsasa@uakron.edu).

For ease of replication, pre-trained UNet(s) used for SuperDiff are available in `SuperDiff/checkpoints`, and `outputs` contain example raw output data from one experiment with conditional SuperDiff and one experiment with unconditional SuperDiff. Additional output data that support the results of the study are available upon reasonable request to the corresponding author at [sdkyuan@gmail.com](mailto:sdkyuan@gmail.com). 

The folder `SuperDiff` contains notebooks for some of the experiments we conducted. There, `diffusion1d-v3-[VERSION]-SAMPLE.ipynb` are the unconditional SuperDiff versions (name corresponds to classâ€”cuprates, pnictides, etc.) and `diffusion1d_v4_ilvr_YBa1.4Sr0.6Cu3O6Se0.51.ipynb` is conditional SuperDiff trained on cuprates conditioned on YBa1.4Sr0.6Cu3O6Se0.51. Code for the other versions of conditional SuperDiff conditioned on various other compounds (including all conditional SuperDiff results presented in the table of generated new families) is available upon reasonable request to the corresponding author at [sdkyuan@gmail.com](mailto:sdkyuan@gmail.com).
