# SuperDiff: Diffusion Models for Conditional Generation of Hypothetical Superconductors

## [Paper on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/)

This is the implementation of SuperDiff, a state-of-the-art method for computationally generating new hypothetical superconductors. SuperDiff is a new method for generating hypothetical superconductors using Diffusion Models and is the first hypothetical superconductor generation method with support for conditioning. This repository contains the code, instructions, and model weights necessary to train or directly run a version of SuperDiff. SuperDiff was created by Samuel Yuan and Sasa Dordevic, you may reach us at [sdkyuan@gmail.com](mailto:sdkyuan@gmail.com) and [dsasa@uakron.edu](mailto:dsasa@uakron.edu).
